# TODOS: 

- improve the UI a little bit

- add a function that checks weather the mouse is over the sketchpad AND one of its button is clicked to insure proper functioning of the sketchpad

- add a slider control to adjust the size of the pad via it, and not with buttons 

- make UI a little bit more better 

- I'll add more later on.
